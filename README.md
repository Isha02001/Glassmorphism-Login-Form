# Glassmorphism-Login-Form
Creating a website allows you to think outside the box and add personal touches to your website according to your choices. Although CSS provides different types of styling for developers, glassmorphism is one of the most visually appealing designs in the field of web design. Glassmorphism is a kind of glass design in which the background of the website is blurred and the content is highlighted, which gives a glassy look to the content of the website.
